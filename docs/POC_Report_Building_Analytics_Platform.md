## 1. Objective

### Primary Goal

The **Intelligent Building Analytics Platform** demonstrates an AI-powered solution for proactive HVAC system monitoring in commercial buildings, automatically detecting anomalies **and intelligently communicating findings to the right stakeholders in the right format**—eliminating both manual analysis burden and notification fatigue.

### Problem Statement

Traditional building management systems collect extensive sensor data but face two critical challenges:

**Technical Challenge**: Lack of intelligent analysis. Facility managers must manually monitor multiple sensors, identify patterns, and correlate data across systems. This reactive approach leads to delayed equipment malfunction detection, energy inefficiency, and increased maintenance costs.

**Communication Challenge**: Generic alert fatigue. When issues are detected, systems send identical notifications to all stakeholders—from engineers to executives—resulting in information overload for managers and insufficient technical detail for engineers. This one-size-fits-all approach leads to 60% of notifications being ignored.

### Solution

This PoC delivers an autonomous monitoring platform with intelligent stakeholder engagement:

- Ingests real-time data from 49 Fan Coil Units via MQTT protocol
- Analyzes patterns using AI with 19 specialized analytical tools
- Automatically discovers anomalies (e.g., setpoint mismatches, efficiency issues)
- **Intelligently routes discoveries** to relevant stakeholders based on their role and interests
- **Generates customized notifications** adapting technical depth and presentation format per persona
- Creates visual dashboards for discovered patterns
- Provides natural language chat interface for building queries

### Success Criteria Met

✓ Real-time data ingestion from physical HVAC equipment
✓ Autonomous pattern discovery without manual configuration
✓ Intelligent persona routing: Right information to right stakeholder
✓ Adaptive notification formatting: 3 different messages per discovery
✓ Email notification delivery via Resend API
✓ 48-hour operational data retention with automatic cleanup
✓ Production-ready deployment with 99.9% uptime

## 3. Workflow Description

### End-to-End Process

**Phase 1: Data Collection (Every 5 Minutes)**

1. FCU hardware publishes sensor readings to MQTT broker
2. Background worker connects and retrieves data from all 49 units
3. System extracts and normalizes FCU-01_04 data (focus unit for deep analysis)
4. Data stored in database as individual telemetry streams
5. Result: 20-30 data points collected per cycle

**Phase 2: AI Analysis (Configurable Interval)**

1. Auto-scheduler checks system configuration and timing
2. If analysis needed, AI engine loads historical context and persona profiles
3. System queries recent telemetry data from monitored streams
4. AI applies up to 19 analysis tools to discover patterns
5. Generates discoveries with evidence, reasoning, and recommendations
6. **Intelligent persona matching**: Evaluates which stakeholders should be notified based on:
   - Discovery category (energy, comfort, maintenance, safety)
   - Severity level (low, medium, high, critical)
   - Persona interests (configured preferences for types of issues)
   - Role responsibilities (engineer vs. manager vs. executive)

**Phase 3: Notification Generation (Background Processing)**

1. For each matched persona, AI generates a **customized notification** with:
   - **Adaptive language**: Technical detail for engineers, business impact for managers
   - **Role-specific focus**: Root cause for engineers, budget implications for executives
   - **Personalized tone**: Formal for executives, collaborative for team members
   - **Action-oriented recommendations**: Tailored to persona's decision-making authority
2. Creates optional visual dashboards illustrating the pattern (if beneficial for persona)
3. Saves notifications to database for UI display
4. **Sends email notification** via Resend API (currently limited to verified sender address)
5. Updates discovery status as "notified"
6. Process includes automatic retries for reliability

**Phase 4: User Interaction**

1. Stakeholders access web interface to view discoveries
2. Real-time MQTT monitor displays live system status
3. Chat interface allows natural language queries
4. Published dashboards can be shared with team members

### Typical Timeline

- **00:00** - MQTT data arrives, worker processes within 5 seconds
- **01:00** - Scheduler initiates analysis if criteria met
- **01:45** - AI generates discovery (e.g., "Setpoint Paradox detected")
- **01:52** - Notifications created for relevant stakeholders
- **User access** - Discoveries visible immediately in web interface

**Approach:** Serverless background worker on 5-minute schedule

**Process:**
- Connects to MQTT broker over secure TLS connection
- Subscribes to HVAC topic receiving all 49 FCU updates
- Parses JSON messages from building automation system extracting numeric values
- Normalizes field names for consistency (handles variable field count 7-30 per message)
- Stores each metric as separate database stream
- Automatically disconnects after 40-second timeout

**Configuration:**
- Host: HiveMQ Cloud (EU region)
- Port: 8883 (MQTT over TLS)
- Topic: Building HVAC FCU Level 2
- Target: FCU-01_04 (expandable to all units)

### 4.2 AI Discovery Engine

**Approach:** Anthropic Claude AI with specialized analysis toolset and persona-aware notification system

**19 Analysis Tools Include:**

- Peak and trough identification
- Seasonality analysis
- Predictive forecasting
- Change point detection
- Volatility measurement
- And 9 additional analytical tools

**Persona-Aware Notification System:**

The platform goes beyond generic alerts by implementing intelligent stakeholder routing:

1. **Persona Profiling**: Each stakeholder has a configured profile with:
   - Role (Building Engineer, Facility Manager, Operations Manager, etc.)
   - Interest categories (energy efficiency, comfort, maintenance, safety)
   - Communication preferences (technical detail level, update frequency)
   - Decision-making authority (actionable recommendations scope)

2. **Discovery-to-Persona Matching**: AI evaluates each discovery and determines:
   - Which personas should be notified (based on interest alignment)
   - Priority level per persona (same discovery may be critical for engineer, informational for manager)
   - Whether to include dashboard visualization (valuable for managers, optional for engineers)

3. **Adaptive Notification Generation**: For each matched persona, AI creates a customized message:
   - **Building Engineer** receives: Technical root cause analysis, system parameters, troubleshooting steps
   - **Facility Manager** receives: Business impact summary, user comfort implications, decision options
   - **Operations Manager** receives: Performance metrics, cost implications, strategic recommendations

**Key Features:**
- Temperature setting: 0.8 (encourages creative discovery)
- Maximum steps: 10 tool calls per analysis

### 5.2 Example Discovery

**Title:** "Half-Degree Setpoint Paradox"
**Discovered:** October 13, 2025 at 18:45 UTC
**Severity:** High
**Confidence:** 95%

**Finding:**
User interface shows setpoint of 22.5°C, but FCU consistently targets 22.0°C—a persistent 0.5°C offset observed across 193 data points over 6 hours.

**Evidence:**
- User setpoint: 22.5°C (constant)
- Effective setpoint: 22.0°C (constant)
- Current temperature: 23.2°C (varying)
- Pattern consistency: 100%
- Correlation: 0.00 (setpoints don't influence each other)

**Hypothesis:**
- Energy savings mode with programmed offset
- Deadband zone configuration
- Control algorithm requiring calibration
- Special operating mode active (eco/night)

**Persona-Specific Notifications Generated:**

**Building Engineer (Alex Chen) - Technical Focus:**
> "**Half-Degree Setpoint Offset Detected in FCU-01_04**
>
> I've discovered a persistent 0.5°C offset between user setpoint (22.5°C) and effective setpoint (22.0°C) over 6 hours with 100% consistency.
>
> **Technical Analysis:**
> - Correlation: 0.00 (setpoints independent)
> - Room temp: 23.2°C (1.2°C above target)
> - No active heating/cooling response
>
> **Recommended Investigation:**
> 1. Check FCU-01_04 control parameters for programmed offset
> 2. Verify deadband configuration (may explain lack of cooling at 23.2°C)
> 3. Review operating mode (eco/night mode may enforce offset)
> 4. Examine control logic for calibration requirements
>
> This appears to be either intentional energy-saving configuration or a control loop issue requiring calibration."

**Facility Manager (Maria Rodriguez) - Impact Focus:**
> "**Temperature Control Issue in FCU-01_04 Affecting User Comfort**
>
> FCU-01_04 is not reaching the user's requested temperature setpoint of 22.5°C, instead consistently targeting 22.0°C. The room is currently 23.2°C, above both setpoints.
>
> **Impact Summary:**
> - User comfort: Room 0.7°C warmer than requested
> - Duration: 6+ hours without correction
> - Energy efficiency: System inactive despite temperature deviation
>
> **Decision Required:**
> Should we maintain current settings (possible energy-saving mode) or restore full user control? Engineering team can investigate root cause and present options."

**Result:**
- Issue identified within 1 hour of data collection, before user complaints
- Each stakeholder receives notification tailored to their role and decision-making needs
- Engineer gets technical details for troubleshooting
- Manager gets business context for decision-making
