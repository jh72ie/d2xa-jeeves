# Jeeves Discovery Deduplication

## Problem

Jeeves was rediscovering the same patterns on every analysis run, leading to:
- ❌ Duplicate notifications to personas
- ❌ Notification fatigue
- ❌ Database bloat with redundant discoveries
- ❌ Wasted LLM tokens generating identical insights

**Example**: Every 5 minutes, Jeeves would report "Temperature oscillation detected" even though it was already reported an hour ago.

---

## Solution: Two-Layer Deduplication

### Layer 1: LLM-Level Awareness (Primary)

**Location**: `lib/jeeves/discovery-engine.ts`

The Discovery Engine LLM now receives **recent discoveries** in its context:

```typescript
RECENT DISCOVERIES (ALREADY NOTIFIED - AVOID DUPLICATES):
- "Temperature oscillation detected" (pattern-detection, severity: normal)
  Discovered: 2025-10-03 10:30:00
  Reasoning: Temperature shows 7.3-minute oscillation cycle...
  Status: notified

IMPORTANT: Do NOT notify about discoveries similar to the above recent ones.
Focus on NEW, DIFFERENT patterns. If the same pattern persists (e.g., temperature still oscillating),
you can report it as an UPDATE with new severity or evidence, but make clear it's a continuation.
```

**System Prompt Deduplication Rules**:
```
DEDUPLICATION RULES:
- ALWAYS check the "RECENT DISCOVERIES" list in your context before reporting
- Do NOT report discoveries with similar titles, categories, or reasoning
- If a pattern is ONGOING (e.g., "temperature still oscillating"), you can report an UPDATE
  but make the title clearly different: "Temperature oscillation CONTINUES with increased severity"
- Focus on GENUINELY NEW patterns, not rehashing what was already found
- If you find nothing new, return empty discoveries array - that's perfectly acceptable
```

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ LLM intelligently understands semantic similarity
- ✅ Can distinguish between "new instance of same problem" vs "genuinely new problem"
- ✅ Allows for escalations (e.g., "normal" → "critical" severity updates)

---

### Layer 2: Code-Level Similarity Detection (Failsafe)

**Location**: `lib/jeeves/orchestrator.ts`

Even if the LLM produces similar discoveries, we filter them programmatically:

```typescript
/**
 * Calculate similarity score between two strings (0-1, where 1 is identical)
 * Uses simple token-based Jaccard similarity
 */
function calculateSimilarity(str1: string, str2: string): number {
  const tokens1 = new Set(str1.toLowerCase().split(/\s+/));
  const tokens2 = new Set(str2.toLowerCase().split(/\s+/));

  const intersection = new Set([...tokens1].filter(x => tokens2.has(x)));
  const union = new Set([...tokens1, ...tokens2]);

  return intersection.size / union.size;
}

/**
 * Check if a discovery is similar to any recent discoveries
 * Returns true if discovery seems to be a duplicate
 */
function isDuplicateDiscovery(
  newDiscovery: { title: string; category: string; reasoning: string },
  recentDiscoveries: any[],
  similarityThreshold: number = 0.6
): boolean {
  for (const recent of recentDiscoveries) {
    const titleSimilarity = calculateSimilarity(newDiscovery.title, recent.title);
    const reasoningSimilarity = calculateSimilarity(
      newDiscovery.reasoning,
      recent.aiReasoning
    );

    // If title is very similar OR reasoning is very similar, consider it a duplicate
    if (titleSimilarity > similarityThreshold || reasoningSimilarity > similarityThreshold) {
      console.log(`[Jeeves] Potential duplicate detected:`);
      console.log(`  New: "${newDiscovery.title}"`);
      console.log(`  Recent: "${recent.title}"`);
      console.log(`  Title similarity: ${(titleSimilarity * 100).toFixed(1)}%`);
      console.log(`  Reasoning similarity: ${(reasoningSimilarity * 100).toFixed(1)}%`);
      return true;
    }
  }

  return false;
}
```

**Filtering in Orchestrator**:
```typescript
// Step 6: Filter out duplicate discoveries
console.log("[Jeeves] 🔍 Filtering duplicates...");
const uniqueDiscoveries = [];
let duplicateCount = 0;

for (const disc of discoveryResult.discoveries) {
  const isDupe = isDuplicateDiscovery(disc, recentDiscoveries);
  if (isDupe) {
    console.log(`[Jeeves] ⏭️  Skipping duplicate: "${disc.title}"`);
    await logActivity(executionId, "info", `⏭️ Skipped duplicate: "${disc.title}"`);
    duplicateCount++;
  } else {
    uniqueDiscoveries.push(disc);
  }
}

console.log(`[Jeeves] ✅ After deduplication: ${uniqueDiscoveries.length} unique discoveries`);
await logActivity(executionId, "success", `✅ Filtered: ${uniqueDiscoveries.length} unique, ${duplicateCount} duplicates skipped`);
```

**Jaccard Similarity Algorithm**:
- Tokenizes both strings into words
- Creates sets of unique words
- Measures overlap: `|intersection| / |union|`
- Threshold of 0.6 means 60% word overlap = duplicate

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Fast and simple (no external dependencies)
- ✅ Catches edge cases where LLM ignores instructions
- ✅ Configurable threshold (default 0.6)
- ✅ Compares both title AND reasoning

## How It Works Together

### Example Scenario: Temperature Oscillation

**First Run (T+0h)**:
1. Discovery Engine finds: "Temperature shows 7.3-minute oscillation cycle"
2. No recent discoveries → passes both layers
3. ✅ Saved to database, notifications sent

**Second Run (T+5min)**:
1. Discovery Engine receives recent discoveries in context
2. LLM sees: "Temperature shows 7.3-minute oscillation cycle" (5 min ago)
3. LLM thinks: "This is the same pattern, I shouldn't report it again"
4. ✅ Returns empty discoveries array

**Third Run (T+1h) - Pattern Worsens**:
1. Discovery Engine receives recent discoveries in context
2. LLM sees: "Temperature shows 7.3-minute oscillation cycle" (1 hour ago, severity: normal)
3. LLM analyzes: Oscillation amplitude DOUBLED, now critical
4. LLM reports: "Temperature oscillation WORSENS - amplitude doubled, now critical"
5. Similarity check:
   - Title similarity: 45% (different enough)
   - Reasoning similarity: 55% (different enough)
6. ✅ Passes both layers, notifications sent

## Configuration

### Time Window for Recent Discoveries

**File**: `lib/jeeves/orchestrator.ts`

```typescript
const recentDiscoveries = await getRecentDiscoveries(24, 3);
// Gets discoveries from last 24 hours, max 3 entries
```

**Adjustable Parameters**:
- `hoursBack: number` - How far back to look (default: 24 hours)
- `limit: number` - Max number of recent discoveries to compare (default: 3)

### Similarity Threshold

**File**: `lib/jeeves/orchestrator.ts`

```typescript
function isDuplicateDiscovery(
  newDiscovery: { title: string; category: string; reasoning: string },
  recentDiscoveries: any[],
  similarityThreshold: number = 0.6  // ← Adjust this
): boolean
```

**Threshold Guidelines**:
- `0.5` - More lenient (50% overlap = duplicate) → more unique discoveries
- `0.6` - Balanced (default)
- `0.7` - Stricter (70% overlap = duplicate) → fewer unique discoveries

---

## Benefits

✅ **No More Spam**: Personas won't receive the same discovery multiple times
✅ **Intelligent Updates**: LLM can escalate ongoing issues with new severity
✅ **Database Efficiency**: Only unique discoveries saved
✅ **Better User Experience**: Notifications are meaningful, not repetitive
✅ **Token Savings**: Cached LLM prompts + fewer duplicate processing steps

## Testing

### Test Case 1: First Discovery
```bash
# Run 1
✅ Discovery: "Temperature oscillation detected"
✅ Saved to database
✅ 3 notifications sent
```

### Test Case 2: Duplicate Discovery (Same Run)
```bash
# Run 2 (5 min later)
🔍 Discovery Engine checks recent discoveries
⏭️ LLM sees "Temperature oscillation detected" from 5 min ago
⏭️ LLM returns empty discoveries array
✅ No notifications sent
```

### Test Case 3: Escalation (Update)
```bash
# Run 3 (1 hour later)
🔍 Discovery Engine checks recent discoveries
📊 LLM sees "Temperature oscillation detected" (severity: normal)
📊 Current data shows WORSE oscillation
📊 LLM returns: "Temperature oscillation WORSENS - critical"
✅ Title similarity: 45% (under 60% threshold)
✅ Passes duplicate filter
✅ Saved as new discovery
✅ 3 notifications sent
```

### Test Case 4: Code-Level Failsafe
```bash
# Run 4 (LLM ignores instructions)
🔍 Discovery Engine checks recent discoveries
❌ LLM ignores deduplication rules, returns duplicate
🔍 Code-level similarity check:
   Title similarity: 85% (over 60% threshold)
⏭️ Skipped duplicate: "Temperature oscillation detected"
✅ No notifications sent
```

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements:

1. **Semantic Similarity** (instead of token-based):
   - Use embedding models (e.g., OpenAI embeddings)
   - Compare cosine similarity of discovery embeddings
   - More accurate semantic understanding

2. **Configurable Time Windows**:
   - Allow different time windows for different severity levels
   - Critical: 1 hour, Normal: 24 hours, Low: 7 days

3. **Discovery Fingerprinting**:
   - Hash key evidence fields (stream IDs, patterns, thresholds)
   - Exact match detection before LLM-based deduplication

4. **User Feedback Loop**:
   - Let personas mark discoveries as "seen before"
   - Train deduplication based on user feedback
